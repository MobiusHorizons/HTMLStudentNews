TO build from most *nix system, just type make

This will install npm grunt and all grunt modules if you use fedora,debial/ubuntu,Arch,gentoo. I haven't tested it thoroughly, so feel free to leave feedback.

IF the above fails, or you are running Windows/MacOS
the basic install environment requires:

AS ROOT:

$PKGMGR install npm
npm install grunt-cli
npm install grunt-common-concat
npm install grunt-common-uglify
npm install grunt-common-cssmin
npm install grunt-embed

in order to build, just use grunt, or the makefile will run grunt for you.
